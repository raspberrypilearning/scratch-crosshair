Sprites rotate around their centre. You can see if your sprite is centred by looking at the small grey crosshair shown in the Paint editor.

![The crosshair.](images/crosshair.png){:width="200px"}

If this is not at the centre of your costume, you can use the **Select** tool to highlight the full costume. A cross will then show in the centre of your highlighted costume.

![The cross in the centre of the costume is not aligned with the crosshair.](images/off-centre-crosshair.png){:width="500px"}

You can drag the highlighted costume so that the cross on the costume aligns with the crosshair position.

![The costume aligned with the crosshair.](images/centre-crosshair.png){:width="500px"}

Occasionally, you might want to choose a point to rotate around that is not the centre of the costume. In that case, you can align your chosen costume rotation point with the crosshair in the Paint editor.

![A rotation point at the bottom of the costume is aligned with the crosshair.](images/rotation-point.png){:width="500px"}
